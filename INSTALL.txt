# phpHelpdesk Installation 
(Alpha version. May have errors. Please let us know if you find one)

NOTE: Currently there are many hard coded references/parameters to our local systems 
      that require many changes in various files to create a functioning system. 
      We expect these to be cleared and placed in a configuration file as appropriate.
       
Assumptions:
1. a functioning web server preferably a LAMP setup
2. a LDAP server to authenticate against
3. a mail server for outgoing messages and incoming requests

INSTALLATION

1. get a copy of the HelpDesk from https://github.com/csatucy/HelpDesk
2. put the code in your web server's tree (default directory: phphelpdesk/)
3. create a MySQL DB (default - DB name: xxxx, DB username: helpdesk)
4. visit configs/config.inc.php and adjust the configuration variables to your local environment
